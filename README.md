Hi, I’m Kartik Bais

I’m a 3rd-year Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in software development, problem-solving, and building real-world applications. I enjoy turning ideas into functional projects using clean logic and scalable code.

I have hands-on experience with C programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, and I’m actively working on web development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). I’m also exploring how AI-powered APIs can be integrated into modern web applications to build smarter systems.
